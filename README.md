# Welcome to Craft!

CraftLang is a minimalistic programming language inspired by Assembly,
as well as various OOP and scripting languages.

The goal of craft is to mainly be a proof-of-concept for a universal programming language, i.e. can compile in multiple different languages.
Right now, its compiler and interpreter is being written in Java, since it's popular and easy to play around with.
